#WorldWise   
This is React.js application where you can open a map and select every city where you've been in.  
You must first login with the dummy account provided, then you can interact with the map.  
Firstly the app will request your location in order to navigate the map close to your city.  
Then you can click on a city on the map where you traveled and a form will appear where you can also add some notes about the city and add the city to your traveled list.  
The app is hosted live here: https://aleksandro-world-wise.netlify.app/
